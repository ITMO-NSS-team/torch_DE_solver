TEDEouS - Torch Exhaustive Differential Equation Solver
=============================



The purpose of the project
--------------------------

1. Make equation discovery more transparent and illustrative
2. Combine power of pytorch, numerical methods and math overall to conquer and solve ALL XDEs(X={O,P}). There are some examples to provide a little insight to an operator form

Core features
-------------

* Solve ODE initial- or boundary-value problems
* Solve PDE initial-boundary value problems
* Use variable models and their differentiation methods
* Faster solution using cache



Installation
------------

TEDEouS can be installed with ``pip``::

$ git clone https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/torch_DE_solver.git
$ cd torch_DE_solver
$ pip install -r requirements.txt


Examples
------------
After the TEDEouS is installed the user may refer to various examples that are in examples forlder. ::

$ cd examples

Every example is designed such that the boxplots of the launches are commented and the preliminary results are not shown, but stored in separate folders.

* Legendre polynomial equation 

::

$ python example_ODE_Legendre.py

or ::

$ python example_ODE_Legendre_autograd.py

* Panleve transcendents (others are placed in 'examples\\to_renew' folder due to the architecture change)
::

$ python example_Painleve_I.py

* Wave equation (non-physical conditions for equation discovery problem) 
::
