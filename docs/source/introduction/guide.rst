How it works
============

Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The architecture itself can be represented as in the figure below:

The solver is implemented so that it can be extended with new methods for solving
differential equations without global changes in the architecture.

To define a new differential equation solution method, it is necessary to define a new solution method **Equation** and the mechanism for determining the derivative **Derivative**.

In TEDEouS, we do not stick to the neural networks - the proposed approach may be extended to an arbitrary parametrized model. 

So, let's move to the each part of architecture.

Equation
~~~~~~~~

The equation module allows to set an O/PDE, boundary and initial conditions, calculation domain.

Moreover, it is possible to choose different approaches to solve an equation. Solver supports methods based on a matrix (linear model without activation layers) and neural network optimizations as well as a method based on pytorch automatic differentiation algorithm.

**Grid**

The grid parameter represents a domain where we want to calculate a
differential equation. The only significant restriction is that only a single-connected
domain may be considered. We do not assume that geometry has a particular shape
- rectangular, circular or any other analytical domain. To preserve generality domain
is represented by the number of points.

**Equation**

We collect all required parameters to equation interface. Interface includes several parameters such as: coefficient, operator, power and optional parameter variable (it must be specified if the equation depends on ùëõ variables, i.e. in case of system solution).

**Boundary and initial conditions**

In the classical solvers, we work with canonical types such as prescribed values (Dirichlet type boundary conditions, it may be a function of boundary) of field or normal differential values (Neumann type boundary conditions) for the entire boundary. Initial conditions are also prescribed values or function at ùë° = 0.
